PHPRecipebook
=============

PHP Recipe Book 5.0

This is a a rewrite of PHPRecipeBook hosted on sourceforge to use Cake MVC.  My goal is to complete the rewrite by the end of the year (2014), but we will see how it goes.  

Improvements I want to make along the way:
* AJAX Page loads (so less refreshes/data between clicks)
* Better/cleaner navigation
* HTML5 (bye bye tables)
* Better Meal Planner UI (Javascript Calendar)
* Integration with other vendors/services

And of course now that we are on GitHub contributions and collaboration should be must easier.  Look forward to anyone with some skills to jump in and keep this moving.

When the basics are working I will put up a Beta site for people to see what is coming.
